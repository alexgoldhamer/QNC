Question 1: 
No, it would not be significant. That is because the p value would be equal to 0.05, not less than 0.05. This is because if somebody gets a positive test, there is a 5% chance it is wrong (false position rate is 5%)
In other words, the probability of getting a + result under the null hypothesis (that they are -) is just the false positive rate, which is 5% or 0.05 (not LESS than 0.05 which is what is needed to claim significance) 

Question 2: 
This question is framed as what is the probability that if someone gets a + test, that person is infected? I think of it as: what is the probability someone is infected GIVEN a + test so P(infected|positive) 
Using the equation you gave us, that probability needs to take into account: P(positive|infected), which is just 1 because the question told us that the false negative rate = 0. 
It also needs to take into account P(infected), which are 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1. That is, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.
Lastly, it needs to factor in P(positive), so how many people are TESTING positive regardless if they are ACTUALLY infected (so they would be a combination of infected and not infected)
This should be equal to P(positive)=P(positive|infected)xP(infected)+P(positive|not infected)xP(not infected)
Therefore, P(positive)=1x0.1 + 0.05x0.9=0.145. 
So now to get P(infected|positive), it's: (1x0.1)/0.145=roughly 69%

For that, I assumed a 0.1% infection rate. Now let's assume a 0.9% infection rate. P(positive) now becomes: (1)(.9)+(0.05)(.1)=0.905.
Therefore, P(infected|positive) becomes: (1)(.9)/0.905 is around 99%.
