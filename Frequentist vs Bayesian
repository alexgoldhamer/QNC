Question 1: 
No, it would not be significant. That is because the p value would be equal to 0.05, not less than 0.05. This is because if somebody gets a positive test, there is a 5% chance it is wrong (it's actually negative; false position rate is 5%)
In other words, the probability of getting a + result under the null hypothesis (that they are -) is just the false positive rate, which is 5% or 0.05 (not LESS than 0.05 which is what is needed to claim significance) 

Question 2:
